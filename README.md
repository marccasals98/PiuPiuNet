## Sound-Based Classification

Reliable identification of bird species in recorded audio files would be a transformative tool for researchers, conservation biologists, and birders. In recent years, artificial neural networks have greatly improved the detection quality of machine learning systems for bird species recognition. We propose a proof of concept that relies on the MEL-scale log-amplitude spectrogram of the audio signal and the use of convolutional neural networks to classify between different species.
