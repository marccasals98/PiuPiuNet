## Sound-Based Classification

Reliable identification of bird species in recorded audio files would be a transformative tool for researchers, conservation biologists, and birders. In recent years, artificial neural networks have greatly improved the detection quality of machine learning systems for bird species recognition. We propose a proof of concept that relies on the MEL-scale log-amplitude spectrogram of the audio signal and the use of convolutional neural networks to classify between different species.

We have worked using different Python Notebooks.

* The Download_data.ipynb is the responsible of downloading the Xeno-Canto dataset using queries.

* The Load_data.ipynb creates the dataset that we are working with

* The Preprocess_data.ipynb is used to make the splits, make MFCC, the noramlisation...

* The Train.ipynb trains the model.
